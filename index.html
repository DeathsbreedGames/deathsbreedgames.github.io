					<p>Similar to GNP, but a lot more fun! You can now play with 4 players, and the objective of the game has changed from protecting your goal, to 
					being the last one to touch the ball before it goes into someone else's.</p>

				<h4><i>30/09/14: Space Run!</i></h4>
				<p>DeathsbreedGames will soon be releasing a new game called <i>Space Run</i>, which will be able to run on Desktop, Browser, and Android! There are currently 
				working versions of the game, but not v1.0, which is when we release it on the website. So feel free to 
				<a href="https://github.com/DeathsbreedGames/SpaceRun/releases" target="_blank" >download pre-releases from Github</a> and report any issues with the 
				<a href="https://github.com/DeathsbreedGames/SpaceRun/issues" target="_blank" >issue tracker</a>. But don't worry, this game will be out soon enough. It will 
				also be available on the Google Play Store for <b>free</b> so that you can stay up to date with all the improvements and fixes without having to download the 
				APK's yourself. Hopefully this <i>Space Run</i> should be done before 2015.</p>
				
				<h4><i>15/08/14: Keeping Up-To-Date</i></h4>
				<p>On this website we show all the DeathsbreedGames projects that have reached v1.0, but that does not mean that they are the only working games. We will 
				often times be working on a new game that is not yet published on the website, but it works perfectly fine. This is because, although it may work, it is 
				not where we want it yet. So if you are interested in playing games before they even come out, visit our 
				<a href="http://github.com/DeathsbreedGames/" target="_blank" >Github Page</a>, click on the project you want to check out, click on releases, and download 
				whatever binaries we provide to run on your computer! <b>NOTE:</b> If the project does not have any releases it is because it doesn't have any real playable 
				content.</p>
				
				<h4><i>31/07/14: DeathsbreedGames website!</i></h4>
				<p>The DeathsbreedGames website is finally out! And with it, we're publishing GNP2 to celebrate. From this point on one will be able to reach all the 
				DeathsbreedGames projects from this site, along with the source-code (the main reason this organization exists, to give you the source-code).</p>
